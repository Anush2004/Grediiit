> ### Instructions to run the code:
- `cd` into frontend folder
- run `npm start`
- The website will be open in the localhost 3000 portal

> ### Others:
- When the page opens, it takes the user to the login portal first. 
- Attached to the same `/` (root) path as login is the registration page as well.
- After registering, it takes you back into the login page.
- The backend for the webiste is not been implemented yet, so username is `admin`  and password is `admin` .
- This takes you to the `/home` page, where the profile page is open.
- Also, once you login, it lets you go directly into the `/home` path.
- There is a specific logout tab in the navigation bar that lets the user log out if they wish to.
